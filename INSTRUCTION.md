# Instructions for contributing

Strictly Follow this guide to organize your code. we are using _components folder method_ i.e each components should have its own folder containing all the codes(css, js,etc) that it needs to execute.

## File structure

-  Starting with **public** folder:- <br>
   - keep this clean and put all the favicon in _favicon_ folder.

- **Src** folder:- <br>
    - _assets_ will be containing images,icons,logos and etc.
    - _components_ this folder will contain each and every components with their own individual folder each containing their respective **Props** and **codes** that they need to run.
    - _redux_ this folder will contain the codes for data management using redux.

### Attention:-

- The Folder named **global** inside the components folder will only contain the **props** that is accessed or needed by more than one components to render.
- Create individual folder for each global props. **Don't put** unnecessary codes or files like images logs in here.
- Their will be certain components that needs **data** to test the **functionality** in that case build a demo data in that **particular** _components or props_ folder and test it. After the backend is ready connect it using redux and remove the demo data.
- Also keep your _assets_ folder organized create folders for better distinctions between each files.
- When naming a **component folder** make sure that the 1st letter should be **capital** that will help in distinguish between folder and the jsx file.
- Make sure you are using the **preferred** Technology framework libraries.
